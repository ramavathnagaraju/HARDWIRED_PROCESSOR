# 🧠 HARDWIRED_PROCESSOR

> 🚀 **A SystemVerilog-based 8-bit Hardwired Control Processor**  
> Designed to simulate a basic CPU architecture using modular design, control logic, and datapath elements.

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a custom-designed **8-bit processor** using **SystemVerilog**, employing a **hardwired control unit** to manage the datapath. It is a simplified model that mirrors the operation of a real CPU, making it ideal for learning architecture-level digital design.

> 🛠️ Built as part of personal learning and portfolio projects to demonstrate my understanding of processor design, digital systems, and HDL (Hardware Description Languages).
